class MigrationGraph(object):
    """
    Represents the digraph of all migrations in a project.

    Each migration is a node, and each dependency is an edge. There are
    no implicit dependencies between numbered migrations - the numbering is
    merely a convention to aid file listing. Every new numbered migration
    has a declared dependency to the previous number, meaning that VCS
    branch merges can be detected and resolved.

    Migrations files can be marked as replacing another set of migrations -
    this is to support the "squash" feature. The graph handler isn't responsible
    for these; instead, the code to load them in here should examine the
    migration files and if the replaced migrations are all either unapplied
    or not present, it should ignore the replaced ones, load in just the
    replacing migration, and repoint any dependencies that pointed to the
    replaced migrations to point to the replacing one.

    A node should be a tuple: (app_path, migration_name). The tree special-cases
    things within an app - namely, root nodes and leaf nodes ignore dependencies
    to other apps.
